Play the good old Tic Tac Toe game in a very fun way.
Call a friend, split turns and choose your favorite icon to play.

    - Every match is made out of up to 3 rounds.
    - Every round that is won will increase your team's points by 1.
    - Wins the team that reach 2 points first, or gets a 1x0 score out of the three rounds.
    - The first team to play will aways be the BONES TEAM ('X'). 
    - In case the current round is won by any of the teams, the next round will start being the losing teams turn.
    - In case of a draw, it will aways start as TEAM SKULL ('O') turn.

    - A round draw will be called 'Cat's game!'.
    - A match (3 rounds) draw will also be considered a 'Cat's game'.
